Computational extinction date estimator for mixed-certainty data

We present a fast, generalized computational method for incorporating reliability scores into any extinction date estimator, and use selected examples to demonstrate its utility.

Use the method script to load examples and run functions.

Use the sensitivity method to generate simulated sighting records, to test/evaluate the method.
